# Calculator and Sudoku Solver

## Calculator (C++)

This project is a simple calculator program implemented in C++. It can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. The calculator uses a stack-based approach to evaluate mathematical expressions.

### Features
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
- Uses a stack to handle operator precedence.
- Can evaluate complex mathematical expressions.

### Usage
1. Compile the `calculator.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Enter a mathematical expression when prompted.
4. The program will output the result of the expression.

## Sudoku Solver (Python)

The Sudoku Solver project is a Python program that solves Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. It takes a partially filled Sudoku grid as input and fills in the missing numbers such that the final grid satisfies all the rules of Sudoku.

### Features
- Solves Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels.
- Uses a backtracking algorithm to efficiently find solutions.
- Outputs the solved Sudoku grid.

### Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run the `sudoku_solver.py` script.
3. Enter the Sudoku grid as a 9x9 matrix, with empty cells represented as 0.
4. The program will output the solved Sudoku grid if a solution exists.
